## üìù Description
- The project "Predicting Medical Costs Billed by Health Insurance" leverages a comprehensive dataset of 1338 entries, encompassing attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and individual medical charges. It aims to analyze how these factors impact medical costs.
 The dataset reflects a broad range of age groups, body mass indices, with an average of about one child per individual, and significant variability in medical expenses.
 Utilizing advanced machine learning models including Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Ensemble methods, the project seeks to delve into the data, unveiling patterns and correlations.
This endeavor is geared towards facilitating the development of robust predictive models, enabling more precise estimations of health insurance costs based on specific individual attributes.



##  Context
This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

##  Content
You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards , you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

##  Problem Statement
You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

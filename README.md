## üìù Overview
This project involves a data analytics exploration and modelling  in the retail sector, particularly focusing on understanding customer behavior through segmentation. The primary objective is to group customers into distinct categories based on their characteristics and purchasing patterns, enabling the retailer to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer service.

* CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
* Gender: The gender of the customer.
* Age: The age of the customer.
* Annual Income (k$): The customer's annual income expressed in thousands of dollars.
* Spending Score (1-100): A score between 1 and 100 assigned by the mall, indicating the customer's spending behavior and purchasing power.

## Analytical Models : 

To segment the customers, the project employs three different clustering algorithms, each offering unique perspectives and clustering approaches:

* K-means Clustering: This popular algorithm partitions the customers into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. It's based on minimizing the variance within each cluster and is known for its simplicity and efficiency.
* Spectral Clustering: This algorithm uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce dimensionality before clustering in fewer dimensions. It's particularly useful for identifying non-linear cluster structures that K-means might miss.
* Agglomerative Clustering: A type of hierarchical clustering that builds nested clusters by merging or splitting them successively. This method provides a tree of clusters, which is helpful in understanding the data's hierarchical structure.

## Objectives and Applications

* Customer Understanding: By segmenting customers, the project aims to gain insights into different customer groups, understanding their specific needs and preferences.
* Targeted Marketing: Utilizing the clusters, marketing strategies can be more effectively tailored to each segment, potentially increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
* Business Strategy: The insights gained can inform various business decisions, such as inventory management, store layout, and promotional offers.
